# Kickstarting with Excel

## We are analyzing the Kickstarter to determine how different play campaigns did in comparison to both their launch dates and their funding goals. 

### Through this analysis, we can determine why certain campaigns were successful, why others failed, or even why some campaigns were canceled.

## Analysis and Challenges
For this specific analysis, we looked at two different aspects. The first being the outcomes based on the launch date, and the second being the outcomes based on goals.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The graph above shows us the relationship between theater campaign outcomes versus their launch date. First, let's note that there are 839 successful campagins, 493 failed campaigns, and 37 canceled campaigns, making to total of 1369 theater campaigns. We can see a few trends occurring here. The first obvious one being that the highest number of successful campaigns all happened in the month of May. Then in June and then in July. The lowest number of successful campaigns happened in December. Based on this information, it would make sense to launch a theater campaign either in the months of May, June or July, and stay away from launching a theater campaign in December.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The graph above shows us the data for the play campaign outcomes based on their goals. For example, we can see that the the plays that had goals either less than 1000 or between 1000 to 4999 were the most successful. This makes sense because that is a very attainable goal! There were 141 successful plays that had goals less than 1000, and a total of 388 successful plays that had goals inbetween 1000 and 4999. In other words, if a future play campaign has a goal that is less than 1000, then it will have a 76% chance of being successful (and a 73% chance of being successful if the goal is inbetween 1000 and 4999).
Looking at the failed play campaigns, we can see that has the goal number went up, so did the amount of failed plays. According to the graph and the data, a play that has a goal inbetween 40000 and 44999 will have a 100% fail rate.
