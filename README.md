# Kickstarting with Excel
## We are analyzing the Kickstarter to determine how different play campaigns did in comparison to both their launch dates and their funding goals. 
### Through this analysis, we can determine why certain campaigns were successful, why others failed, or even why some campaigns were canceled.
## Analysis and Challenges
For this specific analysis, we looked at two different aspects. The first being the outcomes based on the launch date, and the second being the outcomes based on goals.

The graph above shows us the relationship between theater campaign outcomes versus their launch date. We can see a few trends occurring here. The first obvious one being that the highest number of successful campaigns all happened in the month of May.
